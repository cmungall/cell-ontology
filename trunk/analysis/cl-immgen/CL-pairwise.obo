Note that there was some mouse strain variation.

comment: From FMA: \n9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classifiaction is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard]

def: "This cell type produces and secretes melatonin and forms the pineal parenchyma. Extending from each cell body, which has a spherical, oval or lobulated mucleus, are one or more tortuous basophilic processes, containing parallel microtubules known as synaptic ribbons. These processes end in expanded terminal buds near capillaries or less, frequently, ependymal cells of the pineal recess. The terminal buds contain granular endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and electron-dense cored vesicles, which store monoamines and polypeptide hormones, release of which appears to require sympathetic innervation."
